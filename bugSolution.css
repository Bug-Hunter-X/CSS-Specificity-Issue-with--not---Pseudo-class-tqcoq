The solution addresses the specificity issue by improving selector specificity. The `.box.blue` selector's specificity is explicitly increased to override the unintended effects of the `:not()` selector.

```css
.box {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.red {
  background-color: red;
}

.box:not(.red) {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.box.blue {
  background-color: blue !important; /* Increased specificity */
}
```
The `!important` flag is used as a last resort to increase the specificity.  In most situations, restructuring selectors is recommended rather than using `!important`.
