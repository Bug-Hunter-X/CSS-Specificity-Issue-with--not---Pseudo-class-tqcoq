The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue related to the unexpected behavior of specificity when using the `:not()` pseudo-class in combination with multiple selectors.  In this scenario, the specificity of the selector matching the `.box:not(.red)` class unexpectedly affects other elements that are supposed to be unaffected. This results in unintended styling changes. 

```css
.box {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.red {
  background-color: red;
}

.box:not(.red) {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.box.blue{
  background-color: blue;
}
```
